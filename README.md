As they say in Pittsburgh, hey yinz! (Okay that was awful. But regardless, hello!)

I’m Pranavi Rohit,

- 🎓 **Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon**, proud to be part of one of the top-ranked ECE programs in the country.  
- 🧠 **Researcher in CMU’s Kid Neuro Lab**, where I build tools to support cognitive science and developmental research.  
- 🤖 **Deep Tech Institute Intern @ RoboPGH**, one of 10 students selected for a cohort exploring robotics, AI, and deep tech through mentorship, site visits, and storytelling workshops.

> I spend hundreds of hours debugging, fueling my caffeine addiction (my drink of choice is toasted chestnut tea 🍵), to design things that make complex systems feel a little more human.

With that mission in mind, _this_ is what the past few years have looked like.

## KBIT-2 Rapid Score
🔬 **Building a novel automation tool** for scoring psychological assessments (KBIT-2) in CMU’s Kid Neuro Lab—combining OpenCV, Tesseract, and Python into a clean GUI that saves hours of manual work and lifts the hidden labor off new researchers.

## Scholarship Recipient + Presenter @ Harvard
🎂 **Being flown out to the Harvard NORD Rare Disease Hackathon** on my birthday! I co-developed **Heatheria**, an AI-powered, real-time heatmap and recruitment tool for rare disease trials. We built features to identify trial deserts, connect patients to nearby clinical opportunities, and visualize data for over 6,400 rare diseases.

## Intern @ Navy Medical Research Command
🧪 **Researching at the Naval Medical Research Center** (Neurotrauma Dept.), where I studied how blast exposure affects amyloid beta proteins in the brain — a key protein linked to Alzheimer’s. I presented this work at the 2023 Navy STEM Expo, contributing to ongoing research in brain trauma and neurodegeneration.
